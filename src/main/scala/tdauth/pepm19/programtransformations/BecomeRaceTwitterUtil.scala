/**
  * When `become` is called two times, all callbacks are moved into `p`.
  * This means the counter `s` becomes 3.
  * It does not matter if `p` is completed by the completion of `p1` or `p2`.
  * This is invalid behavior since `p0` is now equal to either `p1` OR `p2` but has called the callbacks of both promises.
  * This behavior only occurs because the callbacks are moved to the left promise.
